    <h1>Classic Whiskey Sour</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The whiskey sour is one of the great classic cocktails. It is the standard-bearer of the sour family, which dates back well before the first cocktail book was published in 1862. The simple combination of whiskey, sugar, and fresh lemon juice is one of the most important developments of early mixed drinks and has managed to transcend centuries while spawning hundreds of variations. </p>

    <p>Many folks will also argue that a sour should be served up in a coupe glass, but presentation is the last step in customizing your personal best whiskey sour. Serve it up or on the rocks, with or without egg white, and whatever garnish speaks to you. Go with your heart.</p>
