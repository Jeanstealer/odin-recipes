    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>At its root, a martini is simple, which makes it one of the very best cocktails to practice making for yourself at home. But more than any other cocktail, the martini is a drink you customize; you need to dial it in to your own taste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>60ml vodka or gin</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dry vermouth</li>
            <li>olive or lemon peel, to garnish</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the gin or vodka, dry vermouth and a little ice together or put them in a cocktail shaker to combine. </li>
            <li>Strain into a chilled martini glass. Serve with an olive on a cocktail stick or a twist of lemon peel.</li>
        </ol>
